In the loop "loops" in those who are looking for the local know-how through the Davis Bikeloop.<br><br>The two main features of this site include an interactive map where users can click on key spots around the loop and be able to learn about the history of that spot as well as reviews other visitors have left. The other feature is for those who are already at the bikeloop. Through AR they can walk around in that spot along the bike loop to see notes others have left. These notes could be for anything, including, but not limited to a digital scavenger hunt, a momento for couples who have that spot as special to them, etc.</p>

            <h2>Project Research</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>I first started by researching the bikeloop a lot as a whole. Initially, I went in thinking that a lot of the main spots in Davis would naturlaly be along the bikeloop. To my surprise, this was no the case and there was a lot more digging required to find some key spots to include. From there, I found some spots that appeared to have a lot of history to them.</p>

                <p>Being that my target audience was people who were new to Davis, I spent a fair amount of time interviewing those who we Freshman at Davis. I started by asking them if they had heard of the Davis bikeloop as well as their aspirations for their time in college. A lot of the response that I recieved was how they were eager to make the most out of their experience and that they wanted to learn all the insder's scoop on Davis. In other words, it seemed like they wanted to be integrated with the Davis community despite only being a student there for around 4 years.</p>

            <h2>App Design</h2>

                <img src="originalappdesign.png">
                <p>Pictured to the left is the original design. The thought there was to excite users about the helpful tid-bits they could get from using this site. I initlaly provided minimal information to have people be curious, but still want to explore. I also wanted to show the Davis bikeloop icon to be front and center, so that when people did visit, it could help make the connection between the two and seem more familiar.</p>

                <p>In terms of the color scheme, I wanted to use dark blue as that is the colors of UC Davis as a way to integrate that with the rest of the city. Based on the research, it seemed like the city and the University do a lot of partnering, so I wanted to model that within my design. The images are styled to be similar to a polaroid photo because the polaroid itself is like a connection between the current and past which is also what I was trying to accomplish with this project. It is also supposed to help highlight the key spots almost like photo memories, so that people want to go and make their own memories as well.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="column">
                    <p>For this test, the community partners and some of my classmates tested out my project. The thing I was mostly curious about was how intuitive the site was given how much information I gave per each page. With this being said, my findings was that it was harder for the users to navigate without further instrcution. From here to my final draft, I added in extra information that explained the purposes of each section that could then be taken out later as more people understand the interface.</p>

                    <p>Another one of my main poitns of interest was the "I'm here" section. Being very different to common mobile interfaces, I was curious how the users would react and what they thought they were supposed to do when coming accross this page. With limited instrction, each user thought that they were supposed to take a selfie there at the location. From here I found that once I explained it, they liked the concept, but just wished there was more direct guidance on how to use it.</p>

                <div class="column">
                    <p>Below are the tasks that the users were given:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Pretend like you are currently at a location on the bikeloop and add a note there.</li>
                        <li>Find the history poage for the arboretum.</li>
                        <li>Find the reviews for the walker hall location.</li>

            <h2>Usability Testing &amp; Further Development</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>From here, I decided to pivot and changed the whole homepage to be a more user friendly interface that clearly explained the point of the site and the project. As much as I liked the catchy slogan, I found that the information I put on the page suddenly made it a lot more intuitive. I also upated the logo as I liked having some resemblece of the bike loop icons that go along the path.</p>

                <p>Based on the feedback thinking that the camera was for selfies, I flipped the camera, so it would be more intuitive to be scanning the area around you instead of it being about the user's face. On top of this, I put in a sample note that had the instructions for how that section of the project worked.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>Overall, there was a fair amount of change that the project had to go through to get to where it is now. For instance, originally, I was hoping to use the AR.js library to be able to display the notes. However, I soon found that there were many limiations to using that library and figured that I could try to make my own makeshift version of AR by accessing the user's camera and displaying it on the screen.</p>

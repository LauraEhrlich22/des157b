    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <p>A lot of the article <em>30 Years on from Introduction the Web to the World</em> talked about how much the web has grown since it's creation. I always think it is interesting to think about how people can be so skeptical of inventions that end up being thought of as almost a necessity today. This is especially true with the invention and creation of the internet and web. If you were to then go and ask many gen-zers today if they can imagine a world without the web, I honestly think a lot of them having grown up with having answers in your fingertips for more than half of their life, would answer, no, they can't.
    <br><br>With this all being said, as an individual there are countless website, proejcts, and whatever else you find on the internet that have definitely been impactful to me. However, I think one of the first things that comes to mind would be a simulator that simulates part of the rare neurological visual processing disorder that I have. With my condition, I think there is still so much uncertainty with it, that a lot of people feel like they are crazy, often being accused of doing drugs and having that be the cause. I remember when I was first diagnosed, or first realized what Visual Snow Syndrome (the condition I have) is it was so hard to find any answers on it since it was before there was really any sort of establishment out there for it. I think after a year of searching the web, I eventually came accross <a href="visionsimulations.com">this website </a> that gave me a way to begin to start modeling what I was seeing. I remember feeling a sense of relief of wow! There are others out there too experiencing this, it's a real thing and no I'm not crazy. So, in other words, despite the controversies that come with the internet, there is most definitely good that can come with it.</p>

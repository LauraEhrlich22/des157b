    <h1>Proposal</h1>
    <p>My topic is to create an interactive map of the Davis bikeloop that can help people know where the nearest part of the bikeloop to them is, the history of it. As well as information about each spot on the loop. My target audience would be new Davis residents or students which could help them learn the area. I would like to work with a partner, but I'm not sure who. Some features that I would imagine my project would include is a QR code on each part of the bikeloop as well as showing the sector of the seal that it relates to. I would also need to create a map of some sort maybe one being cartoonish and easy to understand and one being a google maps type thing. With this being said, it does seem like a lot of work for one person, so if I could find someone to work with that would be great. I'm also not sure how the QR code part of the bikeloop would work.

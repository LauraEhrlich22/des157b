    <h1>Observations that Emerged</h1>
    <p>I think that the most common confusion was with the I'm here feature of the project. Every person that tried out the project thought it was for them to take a selfie. In general, the other feedback was that people weren't sure what to do from the homepage and wished there was more information in genral.</p>

    <h1>Plan to update capstone project</h1>
    <p>Overall, I am hoping to be adding a lot more instructions to each page. I think that I will be changing the front page a lot and making it more explanatory than image-based. This will also be true for the map as well as the camera portion. I will also be making the camera a back-facing camera instead of front-facing. Finally, I will be adding in more ways to incoroporate the seal with it being in the loading page as well as feature as a little image on the tops of each history page.</p>
